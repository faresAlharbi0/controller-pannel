in this controller panel i used node js to handle the backend while i used
javascript to handle smooth animitions with the GSAP api, it has a container with the 5 buttons
and a side panel that expands or closes as you click the expand icon, in the side panel you will find
a history if presssed buttons and their directions, and the time they were pressed.
